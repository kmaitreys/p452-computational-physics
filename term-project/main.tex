\section{Introduction}
Consider a mono-atomic or singly-charged chemical species in gaseous state with
\(N\) energy levels defined as \(E_i\) with \(i = 1 \ldots N\) in ascending
order. Pertaining to the temperature this chemical species exists at, each
level will have certain occupation or population. These occupation numbers can
change due to collisions between neighboring molecules and if the environment
is sufficiently dense and temperatures are sufficiently high, this population
distribution can be deemed as thermal and can be expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
    \dfrac{N_j}{N_i} = {e}^{-(E_j - E_i)/k_B T}
\end{equation}
Here, \(N_i\) (and \(N_j\)) represents the level occupation number density of state
\(i\) (and \(j\)), \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant and \(T\) is the temperature of the
gas. This thermal distribution is basis for the condition of \textit{local thermodynamic
    equilibrium} or LTE.\@ In other words, the mean free path of the (excited) molecules
is much, much less than the scales at which the temperature varies in the medium.

Equation~\ref{eq:1} can be modified to include the degeneracies of states through
statistical weights, which results in
\begin{equation}
    \dfrac{N_j}{N_i} = \dfrac{g_j}{g_i} {e}^{-(E_j - E_i)/k_B T}
\end{equation}
where \(g_i = 2l+ 1\), \(l\) being the orbital angular momentum of electron in state
\(i\). And finally, we can obtain the fractional occupational numbers \(n_i\) using the
partition function \(Z(T)\) as
\begin{equation}
    n_i = \dfrac{1}{Z(T)} g_i {e}^{-E_i / k_B T}
\end{equation}
